Introduction:
NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) have become a major phenomenon in the world of cryptocurrency, digital art, and collectibles. One of the most lucrative strategies to profit from NFTs is sniping—acquiring underpriced or rare NFTs as soon as they become available on marketplaces. Sniping requires precision, speed, and the ability to act before others in a competitive market.

The goal is to acquire these valuable assets before others have a chance to notice the opportunity. Effective sniping demands speed and knowledge of market trends.
